1. Git repository

Git repository is where I upload all my codes. It has two sections for client and server and a readme file. At each point after i made small changes to my code, i add, commit and push it to the master branch. By doing so, if I did something wrong which make the program stop running, I can easily move back to the previous version and try other ways to code.
